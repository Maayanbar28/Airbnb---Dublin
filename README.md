# Airbnb-Dublin
This Airbnb data analysis project looks at customer behavior and preferences to improve the booking process. The analysis identifies the top countries with the most searches and examines room availability, preferred room types, and booking lengths. Recommendations include offering special prices for stays of varying lengths, creating deals based on what customers like, and offering promotions for rooms booked without prior searches. These insights can help Airbnb improve its business and make customers happier.

## Business Questions:
•	From which countries will the highest number of searches originate?/
•	What was the room availability the guests searched for?/
•	What is the most searched room type?/
•	For how many nights the guests were searching for a room?/
•	Which countries have actually placed real orders?/
